But slowing it down by finding a couple of projects I could do with it and narrowing it down made it so much easier. I began with the basics, the print functions, the first “hello world” and then went on to make a converter for currencies, the joy I had from seeing the code work was priceless, the dread from when it didn’t make me more scared. But this love for code then involved into web automation and making many mundane tasks I had at the time done quicker. It took me around a year to learn the necessary steps I needed but I still have a long journey ahead which I can't wait for! ",

I searched it up, found tutorials and eminently fell in love with it. The 3D view I was given from it and the capabilities that I couldn’t get from ordinary 2D software blew my mind. I remember rendering my first project, a doughnut, I was so proud of myself, yet I wanted to push myself even further. I would always try learning all the different functions of the blender, the nodes, the textures and how each part works. I became very good quickly and after 3 years I'm proud of where I am and what I have accomplished, iv gotten commission and even started a shop selling the models I had made which came quite profitable.",
